 * Adaptive histogram based on something like streaming k-means crossed with Q-digest.

 * The special characteristics of this algorithm are:
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * a) smaller summaries than Q-digest
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * b) works on doubles as well as integers.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * c) provides part per million accuracy for extreme quantiles and typically &lt;1000 ppm accuracy for middle quantiles
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * d) fast
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * e) simple
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * f) test coverage &gt; 90%

 * g) easy to adapt for use with map-reduce
